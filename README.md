This is a Github Pages Website

 cleaned it up  a little bit, tried improving it a bit, ended up not liking it enought to continue it so i ended up building my current website. Hope you like it! 


It's using Threejs to give my website a cool background.

Some implicit features are if you press: 

  'Y,U,I,O" You can change
  the speed and size of the sphere!

  Pressing 'P' gives you XYZ axes.

  Left click mouse rotates.
  Right click pans.
  Scroll to zoom.
